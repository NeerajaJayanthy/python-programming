        "The School Lockers Puzzle: On the first day of school, the principal of Locker High school decides to conduct an experiment. The school has exactly 1,000 students and 1,000 lockers all lined up alongside the main corridor of the school.\n",
        "âThe principal asks the first student to walk down the main corridor of the school to close all the lockers.\n",
        "âThe principal then asks the second student to walk down the main corridor and open every other locker.\n",
        "âThe principal then asks the third student to walk down the main corridor and either open every third locker if it is closed, or close it if it is open.\n",
        "âThe fourth student will then repeat the same process for every fourth locker.\n",
        "âAnd so on, till the last of the 1,000 students repeats this process for every 1,000th locker, so in fact, just opening the 1,000th locker if it is closed, or closing it if it is already open.\n",
        "At the end of this experiment the principal decides to count the number of lockers which are closed.\n",
        "Write a python program to simulate this experiment and at the end, count and output the total number of lockers which are closed."
